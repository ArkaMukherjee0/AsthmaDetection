# Asthma Disease Prediction
ML models are effectively used to solve the problem of asthma disease detection with statistical data from a Kaggle dataset. The models were trained and evaluated on a variety of parameters. 
Pre-processing and ensemble techniques such as PCA and bagging were utilized to further increase the performance of the models.

This repository contains a Python script for predicting asthma disease using various machine-learning models. The script performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.



## ðŸ’¾ **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is stored in `asthma_disease_data.csv`, which includes various patient attributes such as demographics, medical history, environmental exposures, and lung function measurements.
